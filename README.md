This is a web application that allows users to rent out properties.

```
As a signed in owner,
So that I can list my property,
I want to be able to create a listing.

```
As a signed in owner,
So that I can list all of my properties,
I would like to be able to list multiple places.

so that I can give a more full description of my property,
I should be able to name, describe and add a price.
```

```
As a signed in owner,
So that I can organise my renting schedule,
I should be able to offer a range of dates when the space is available.
```

```
As a signed in user,
So that I can rent a property,
I should be able to request to hire a space for a given date.
```

```
As a signed in owner,
So that I can rent a property,
I should be able to approve a user's request.
```

```
As a signed in owner,
So that no renting conflicts occur,
I should not be able to rent out my space to multiple users on the same night.
```

```
As a signed in user,
So that all users can get a property,
A space can still be booked for that night until a user confirms a booking request.
